## 🛠 Recommended Immediate Next:

**→ Implement login with JWT and auth middleware**

Would you like me to scaffold the **login logic** and **JWT auth middleware** for you now?

🚀 Here’s the Updated Backend Roadmap
We’ll continue step-by-step from here:

✅ 1. Register Endpoint
(Currently working on — you'll finish this next)

🔒 2. Logout Functionality
Invalidate session (delete token from DB).

Route: POST /api/auth/logout

Requires protect middleware

Deletes session by token

👤 3. Get User Profile
Route: GET /api/users/me

Use req.user.id to fetch info

📚 4. Book Model + Seeding
Define Book model (title, author, price, genre, description, cover URL, file URL, etc.)

Seed some books into DB

📖 5. Public Book Browsing
Routes:

GET /api/books (with filters: genre, author, price range)

GET /api/books/:id (get details)

🛒 6. Cart System
Since we're using sessions per login, we can:

Store cart server-side (or DB-based temp storage)

Add/update/remove items in cart

Save for later (wishlist)

💳 7. Checkout & Payments
Integrate Stripe or Razorpay

Create Order model

On success, deliver digital file access

📥 8. Digital Delivery
Allow downloading purchased files

Optionally show inline reader (PDF preview)

📊 9. Admin Panel Features
CRUD for books

View all users/orders

Analytics dashboard (downloads, revenue)
